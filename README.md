Kinematic Optimization of SHMS and HMS using Hydrogen Elastic Reactions for Deuteron Electro-Disintegration Studies at Jefferson Lab

This code was written by Walker Law during an REU at The Catholic University of America in the Summer of 2025.

The main kinematic optimization code is in the directory "matrixoptim", with various models located there. Most of the other directories in this repository are there in order to extract data from the .root files, input the data into a .csv file, which can then be used in the matrixoptim models. The latexposter folder is full of the latex code that was made to create the poster for this project.

Most data used during this REU was put in a spreadsheet, located here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b-u-OBswPESYv636p8zfxYJ0PP2iePAz2Yrf8J8EZxs/edit?usp=sharing
